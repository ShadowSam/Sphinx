Opensource software utilized:
  - Mongo
  - Play
  - Elasticsearch


##Setting Up Your Environment:

No matter what environment you're running, you'll need to grab the play framework from http://www.playframework.com/

1. Unzip Play
2. Make sure that javac and java are on your Path
3. cd to the project (That you totally already cloned)
4. run play.bat in this directory
  * The terminal command on Windows will be something like ../../path/to/play/play.bat
  * On Mac or Linux, you should be able to run the non bat play application instead
5. If you are using eclipse, type "eclipse" once the play terminal starts
  *For other IDEs, check out http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.x/IDE
6. Now you should be able to import this as an eclipse project!

###Longer Term Setup
*You'll probably want to add play to your path
